### Further Programming - Individual Project

------

### Locations of files

* **Main** class is in `src/main/java/S3800978/main/Main.java`.
* **Source** code is in `src/main/java/S3800978/sources/`.
* **Test** classes are in `src/test/java/S3800978/sources`.

### Some note to make marking easier

* Fields and functions in stated in requirement are commented with `// REQUIREMENT`.
* To view source code easier, collapse all code and expand as you go. Code sections have `//region` to make organizing and viewing easier.
* Functions and fields have JSDoc explanations.

### Product name note

* `PhysicalProduct` and `DigitalProduct` cannot have the same `name`. The prefix `PHYSICAL - ` and `DIGITAL - ` is NOT saved with the name. The prefix is only appended when the name is printed or displayed. This satisfies the unique name requirements across all types of products.
